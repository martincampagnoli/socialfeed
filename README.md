# Social Feed

Social feed app created using Angular as frontend framework, [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) as backend for storage and authentication, and [Angular Material](https://material.angular.io/) for design and styling.

Logged Users are able to create text posts and comment on any of them.
'Like' functionality is available for logged users as well.
Guest users can view any post with its comments and 'likes' count but are not able to interact with them.
Posts run in feed showing up from top to bottom, from oldest to newest.
