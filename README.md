# Social Feed

Social feed app created using [Angular](https://angular.io/) as frontend framework, [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) as backend for storage and authentication, and [Angular Material](https://material.angular.io/) for design and styling.

Logged Users are able to create text posts and comment on any of them.<br/>
'Like' functionality is available for logged users as well.<br/>
Guest users can view any post with its comments and 'likes' count but are not able to interact with them.<br/>
Posts run in feed showing up from top to bottom, from oldest to newest.<br/>
